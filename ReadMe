“sudo chgrp -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache” 
The chgrp (change group) command alters the group name that a file or directory belongs to. 
Each file in Linux is created by a user, while each user belongs to groups. 
By changing the group ownership of a file, the permissions to access and modify a file changes as well.
Since the chgrp command requires superuser permissions, remember to run the command with the sudo prefix for proper execution.

“sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache"
These flags are called file permissions or modes, as in "mode of access." 
The command name chmod stands for "change mode." It restricts the way a file can be accessed.
